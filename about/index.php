                <h2>The "why" behind this site</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <p>Hiya! My name is <a href="https://davemart.in">Dave Martin</a>.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've been extremely blessed in my career as a product designer. I want to give back by sharing some of the things that I've learned.</p>
            <h2>My vision</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Anyone can become a designer</strong><br>
                With commitment and practice I strongly believe that ANYONE can become a product designer. Even you!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Everyone is welcome</strong><br>
                Enrollment is open to anyone. This school is and always will be free.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Practical, not academic</strong><br>
                The focus of the courses that I will share will be around teaching practical skills not academic theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Avoid college debt</strong><br>
                The system we have now where designers are forced to go thousands of dollars into debt before they can even start designing is antiquated. You <a href="https://davemart.in/dont-pay-for-design-school/">don’t need a degree to become a designer</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Lessons that come to you</strong><br>
                Eventually, I'd like to build out a way for yout to add lessons to a queue and have your next lesson automatically emailed to you daily.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Collaborative effort</strong><br>
                I’d love to invite any designer who has benefitted from their career in design to give back to the next generation of designers by collaborating with me on this project. If you have any interest in getting involved, <a href="mailto:designpro@gmail.com">please reach out</a>.
